## Hello World
"Lorem ipsum" is a placeholder text commonly used in the design and publishing industries as a temporary filler for content that is not yet available. It is typically used to demonstrate the visual effects of different fonts, layouts, and designs without using actual content.
The text itself is derived from a passage in a treatise by the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero, and consists of scrambled Latin words that do not form coherent sentences. Despite its lack of meaning, "Lorem ipsum" has become a standard placeholder text in the design industry and is widely recognized by designers, publishers, and typesetters.
```rust
use std::io();

fn main() {
	println!("Sample Rust code");
	let mut userInput = String::new()
	io::stdin().read_line(&mut userInput);
```
